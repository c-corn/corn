(** In the following type class, r is an "output parameter" in the sense
 that we will have unification infer it. We cannot turn r into a field instead,
 because that would hide it behind a projection, which hinders further
 scrutiny. *)

Class PointFree {T} (f r: T): Prop := pointfree_eq: f = r.

(** If no other instances match, give up and declare the thing point-free: *)

Instance proper_pf {T} (x: T): PointFree x x | 9.
Proof. firstorder. Qed.

Instance eta_pf {A B} (f: A → B) `{!PointFree f f'}: PointFree (λ x, f x) (f' ∘ id)  | 10.
Proof. firstorder. Qed.

   PointFree (λ x: A, (f x, g x)) (map_pair f' g' ∘ diagonal).
Proof. compute. rewrite PointFree0, PointFree1. reflexivity. Qed.
  (* This one may not be strictly needed in the presence of binapp_pf below. *)

  `{!PointFree f f'} `{!PointFree g g'}: PointFree (λ x, f (g x)) (f' ∘ g').

  `{!PointFree f f'} `{!PointFree g g'} `{!PointFree h h'}:
     PointFree (λ x: D, f (g x) (h x)) (uncurry f' ∘ map_pair g' h' ∘ diagonal).

  (* In the following tests, the Print's should show that the second argument inferred for PointFree is actually point-free. *)
Definition test0: PointFree (@fst (unit*unit) unit) _ := _.
Check test0.

(* Todo: The set of instances currently generates "uncurry const" (which is equivalent to "fst") sometimes (e.g. for test4 above).
 If this turns out to be annoying, we can probably get rid of it by adding more specialized and prioritized instances. *)
